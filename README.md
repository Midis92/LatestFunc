<h1>Azure Cloud Function for IoT Temperature Data</h1>
This repository contains the code for a function designed to be used with Azure Cloud. It was developed as a component of an IoT architecture project that aimed to collect and process temperature data.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The primary objective of this project was to capture temperature readings from a Raspberry Pi and showcase the data on a web platform, visualized in the form of a graph. The entire architecture was built with multiple components, including an IoT hub and other Azure services.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
Raspberry Pi: The initial data source, where temperature readings are collected in real-time.
Azure IoT Hub: Acts as the central message hub for bi-directional communication between the IoT application and the devices it manages.
Azure Cloud Function (This Repository): Processes the data sent to the IoT Hub and prepares it for visualization.
Website: Displays the processed temperature data on a graph, providing a visual representation of the readings over time.
